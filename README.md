# Terminotes

Terminotes is a terminal-first note taking CLI focused on fast capture with tags, SQLite persistence, and automatic git sync. The project is in early scaffolding; follow `AGENTS.md` and `TODO.md` for contributor guidance and implementation stages.

## Getting Started

```bash
uv sync
uv run python -m terminotes --help
```

Use the `Justfile` shortcuts to run common workflows once the environment is bootstrapped.
